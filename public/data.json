This approach has been embraced by many organizations in a variety of industries, and is often seen as a key driver of innovation and progress. I first experienced this culture when I worked at Xtreme Labs. I loved the concept that it’s okay to try new things and if it fails it’s a learning experience. This culture grew with me and is now a pillar here at TribalScale.</p><h3>Origins and Benefits of Fail Fast</h3><p>The origins of the fail fast mentality can be traced back to the lean startup movement, which emphasizes the importance of rapid experimentation and iteration in the development of new products or services. The idea is to test hypotheses and gather data as quickly as possible in order to identify which ideas are viable and which ones are not. By failing fast, organizations can avoid investing significant resources in projects that are unlikely to succeed, and instead focus on those that have the greatest potential for success.</p><p>There are several benefits to adopting a fail fast mentality. For one, it allows organizations to identify and address problems or failures quickly, minimizing the negative impacts that they can have. This can help to minimize losses and minimize the disruption caused by these problems or failures. Additionally, a fail fast mentality can encourage a culture of innovation and experimentation, as it allows individuals and teams to take risks and try new things without the fear of failure.</p><h3>Fail Fast Doesn’t Mean Failure is Desirable</h3><p>One key aspect of the fail fast mentality is the importance of learning from failures. When an organization fails fast, it is able to quickly gather data and insights about what went wrong and use this information to improve processes and systems in the future. This can help to build resilience and improve the chances of success in the long run.</p><p>At TribalScale we talk about our fail fast moments every morning at standup and in a dedicated slack channel. This has many returns that make a lot of business sense. Our tribe is always willing to find something that didn’t work and help other team members find solutions. When a failure is hidden it usually gets compounded over time with many other failures causing teams to derail and FAIL BIG.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that the fail fast mentality does not mean that failure is desirable or should be actively sought out. Rather, it is about recognizing that failures and problems will inevitably occur and being proactive in addressing them in a timely manner. This requires a culture that is open to learning from mistakes and that encourages individuals to speak up about problems or concerns.</p><h3>How To Embrace Fail Fast In Your Organization</h3><p>There are several ways that organizations can embrace the fail fast mentality. One is by implementing agile development processes, which allow for rapid iteration and testing of ideas. This can be particularly effective in the early stages of product or service development, when there is still a lot of uncertainty about what will work and what won’t.</p><p>Another way to embrace the fail fast mentality is by setting up systems and processes that allow for rapid experimentation and iteration. This can include things like A/B testing, which allows organizations to test different versions of a product or service in order to identify the most effective approach. It can also involve using data analytics to track progress and identify areas where improvements can be made.</p><p>Finally, it is important for organizations to create a culture that is open to learning from failures. This can involve providing employees with the support and resources they need to take risks and try new things, and encouraging open communication about problems and failures. It can also involve creating a safe space for employees to share their thoughts and ideas, and rewarding those who are willing to take risks and try new things.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>In conclusion, the fail fast mentality is a philosophy that advocates for quickly identifying and addressing problems or failures in order to minimize their negative impacts and maximize the potential for success. It is a key driver of innovation and progress, and it requires a culture that is open to learning from mistakes and that encourages experimentation and iteration. By embracing the fail fast mentality, organizations can increase their chances of success and build resilience over the long term.

It does this by providing a set of templates that are designed to meet driver distraction standards across the world and are capable of adapting to different car screen sizes and input modalities.</p><h3><strong>Pre-defined Templates in AAOS</strong></h3><p>The <em>Android for Car App Library</em> has a very concise set of templates to implement your app design. These templates allow for consistency across any OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and also ensure that developers stay within the bounds of a UI that is optimized for driver distraction.</p><p>However, the templates can become restrictive in terms of user experience and there are very limited options when making changes to the user interface, hence resulting in apps that look very similar to each other.</p><p>All templates are provided by Google which have little to no room for customization. Custom styling of <em>Screens</em> and their elements are restricted according to the OEM defined styling.</p><h3>Template Restrictions</h3><p>There is a template limitation of 5 maximum applied to a given task, of which the last template of the 5 must be one of the following types: <em>NavigationTemplate</em>, <em>PaneTemplate</em> or <em>MessageTemplate</em>. If the app attempts to send a new template, the host will display an error message and close the app.</p><p>For example, if each <em>Screen</em> is structured to send a single template, then the app can push 5 <em>Screen</em> instances onto the <em>ScreenManager</em> stack. There are special cases to these restrictions: template refreshes, back and reset operations.</p><h4><strong>Template Refreshes</strong></h4><p>Template refreshes<strong> </strong>allow the app to refresh the templates without crossing the maximum template limit. If the current template is of the same type and contains the same main content with some values updated, the template will not be counted against the quota.</p><h4><strong>Back Operations</strong></h4><p>The <em>ScreenManager</em> stack of screens is monitored by the host for detecting if a screen is being popped; this keeps an update on the quota of screens still available for the app to show.</p><p>The app is restricted to use the same template when popping back a screen, sending a different template will cause an error.</p><h3>The Car UI Library</h3><p>To develop a fully customizable app, a developer can make an app directly integrated into the OEM. For that purpose the <em>Car UI library</em> can be used, which is a statically linked library that provides a set of components and resources you can use to implement the following:</p><ul><li>System and OEM apps (Gerrit)</li><li>Android Automotive (AAOS) apps</li></ul><p>However such an app will not be available on Google Play store and direct collaboration with the car manufacturer will be required.</p><h3>More Challenges</h3><h4><strong>Android Automotive Emulators</strong></h4><p>Another challenge currently faced is that AAOS emulators only run on Intel based Macs.

As an alternative, we can use third party apps.</p><h4><strong>Supported Libraries</strong></h4><p>Some libraries are not supported by Android Automotive apps, however this is not properly documented anywhere. This leads to significant confusion and developers having to do trial and error to see which ones are working properly.</p><h4>Sample AAOS Apps</h4><p>The sample apps provided by Google are all in Java whereas in documentation we have references to Kotlin code snippets.

There are many fields of development including the diagnosis of diseases using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, mobile applications and wearable technology, brain computer interfaces, and 3D printing! Let’s review them:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NP8Cz5vsRWUGFZ30BswxmA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/medical-technology?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></h4><p>Artificial intelligence is an up and coming technology that is involved or is on the brink of involvement in nearly every aspect and process available today. The MedTech industry has greatly benefited from this as the diagnosis of diseases. Using predetermined sets of data, a machine is able to receive key components of a patient and produce an accurate conclusion. For example, the <a href=\"https://eberlin.cm.utexas.edu/masspec-pen/\">MasSpec pen</a> is a device that is able to differentiate between cancerous and healthy tissues using biomarkers and machine learning. Currently, it can take hours and multiple professionals to distinguish between the two. The pen will allow for molecules to be classified in the operating room.</p><h4><strong>Brain Computer Interfaces</strong></h4><p>Brain Computer Interfaces have been a large part of up and coming technologies. Companies like <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/\">Neuralink</a> and <a href=\"https://synchron.com/\">Synchron</a> are hopping on the market and have created devices that are able to convert motor signals from the brain into actions. Those suffering with paralysis will benefit from services that allow them to utilize technology that would otherwise not be available. Although the development of the economy has slowed down, <a href=\"https://www.massdevice.com/gates-bezos-synchron-75m-bci/\">Synchro (a startup) received funding of 75 million dollars</a> for their recent development in BCI.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w-DCc5s1iTzQJl01YYA0sg.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/de/@linkedinsalesnavigator?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">LinkedIn Sales Solutions</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/video-call?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Online Welfare</h4><p>Due to the pandemic, many services have had to be offered online to ensure patients still have access to them. Mental health has also been a major aspect of the healthcare system that had to adapt to online welfare.

There are many fields of development including the diagnosis of diseases using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, mobile applications and wearable technology, brain computer interfaces, and 3D printing! Let’s review them:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NP8Cz5vsRWUGFZ30BswxmA.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/medical-technology?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></h4><p>Artificial intelligence is an up and coming technology that is involved or is on the brink of involvement in nearly every aspect and process available today. The MedTech industry has greatly benefited from this as the diagnosis of diseases. Using predetermined sets of data, a machine is able to receive key components of a patient and produce an accurate conclusion. For example, the <a href=\"https://eberlin.cm.utexas.edu/masspec-pen/\">MasSpec pen</a> is a device that is able to differentiate between cancerous and healthy tissues using biomarkers and machine learning. Currently, it can take hours and multiple professionals to distinguish between the two. The pen will allow for molecules to be classified in the operating room.</p><h4><strong>Brain Computer Interfaces</strong></h4><p>Brain Computer Interfaces have been a large part of up and coming technologies. Companies like <a href=\"https://neuralink.com/\">Neuralink</a> and <a href=\"https://synchron.com/\">Synchron</a> are hopping on the market and have created devices that are able to convert motor signals from the brain into actions. Those suffering with paralysis will benefit from services that allow them to utilize technology that would otherwise not be available. Although the development of the economy has slowed down, <a href=\"https://www.massdevice.com/gates-bezos-synchron-75m-bci/\">Synchro (a startup) received funding of 75 million dollars</a> for their recent development in BCI.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w-DCc5s1iTzQJl01YYA0sg.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/de/@linkedinsalesnavigator?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">LinkedIn Sales Solutions</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/video-call?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Online Welfare</h4><p>Due to the pandemic, many services have had to be offered online to ensure patients still have access to them. Mental health has also been a major aspect of the healthcare system that had to adapt to online welfare. There are now applications that are available to talk to or seek help from a mental health professional. Apps like <a href=\"https://www.betterhelp.com/\">BetterHelp</a> do a great job of providing people with immediate responses for their needs.

Here are some of the top trends to watch out for:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SAFCp4FN47aFwLr9kw808A.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jonasleupe?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Jonas Leupe</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/fintech?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Continued Adoption of Open Banking and API-based Services</h4><p>Open banking, which involves the use of APIs to enable secure sharing of financial data between institutions and third-party providers, has been on the rise in recent years. This trend is expected to continue in 2023, with more banks and financial institutions offering open banking services and more third-party providers leveraging these APIs to offer new and improved financial services.</p><h4>Growth of Digital-only Banks and Neobanks</h4><p>Traditional banks have been facing increasing competition from digital-only banks and neobanks, which offer convenient and user-friendly mobile banking services. These banks are typically able to offer lower fees and higher interest rates than traditional banks, and are gaining popularity among younger consumers. We can expect to see even more growth in this sector in 2023.</p><h4>Increased Use of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h4><p>While the use of blockchain and cryptocurrency has been somewhat controversial in the past, they are becoming increasingly mainstream. In 2023, we can expect to see more banks and financial institutions exploring the use of blockchain technology for a variety of applications, from enhancing security and reducing fraud to streamlining cross-border payments. The use of cryptocurrency is also likely to continue to grow, with more businesses accepting it as a form of payment and more consumers using it for everyday transactions.</p><h4>Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h4><p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are already being used in the financial industry for tasks such as fraud detection and risk assessment. In 2023, we can expect to see these technologies being used even more widely, with the potential to revolutionize everything from personal finance management to investment advice. For example, AI-powered personal finance assistants could help consumers make more informed financial decisions, while machine learning algorithms could be used to identify and invest in promising new companies.</p><h4>Expansion of Financial Services to Underserved Communities</h4><p>Expansion of financial services to underserved communities, one of the biggest challenges facing the financial industry is the lack of access to financial services in underserved communities. In 2023, we can expect to see more fintech companies focusing on addressing this issue, through the use of mobile banking, digital currencies, and other innovative technologies. This trend is not only good for consumers in these communities, but also has the potential to drive economic growth and development.</p><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><p>Overall, the fintech industry is set for exciting times in 2023. With continued adoption of open banking and API-based services, the growth of digital-only banks and neobanks, the increasing use of blockchain and cryptocurrency, advances in AI and machine learning, and the expansion of financial services to underserved communities, there are many opportunities for innovation and growth.

It was launched in Nov 2022. It is based on OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model and trained on an Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*FJdH5UEbmVfTHg7s\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\">ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Now you must be thinking how is it useful to us? Well, it provides very factual detailed responses to every question asked. Their website claims the following:</p><blockquote>While we have safeguards in place, the system may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information and produce offensive or biased content. It is not intended to give advice.</blockquote><blockquote>Conversations may be reviewed by our AI trainers to improve our systems.</blockquote><p>This leads us to the conclusion that we cannot solely rely on the accuracy as it’s in a childhood phase. The best part is that ChatGPT is a stateful bot, unlike other chatbots. This gives us hope that given the right information, it’ll remember the right kind of data.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xUaNPnt8q0AgOmUTmcKj9g.png\" /><figcaption>It’s setting right examples, even if a kid tries it 😋</figcaption></figure><p>It also filters data through its own moderation API, ensuring no illegal, hateful or offensive prompts. Here’s an example of the moderation upon asking for a sample of a ‘Phishing email’ :</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/843/1*H2UHb1pzxV1ZKjv1vQdqBw.png\" /></figure><p>For developers who are looking for some error finding in their code, they can rely on ChatGPT. We are still not claiming complete accuracy and efficiency here. But it’s still something.</p><p>But hold your horses…</p><p>One of the biggest cons of ChatGPT is that it may learn vague information from users and present prompts like a CEO is a white male.</p><p>Also, it might not have complete knowledge of current events or some celebrities. Of course, we can’t expect it to be as knowledgeable as Google, as it was released recently. But it’s evolving fast.</p><p>So far it has had positive reviews from people around the globe. Alas, I can’t find the answer to one of life’s <strong>biggest</strong> mysteries (Notice I changed the first word of the question, leading to a completely opposite reply. No judgement on my grammatical skills 😂🤫):</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oOla2iC9fQVbUgF70cL1WQ.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*T8A7Jf43ULDH1D4-b052ow.png\" /></figure><p>Overall, I would say it would be a great tool to get personalized and human- like replies quite quickly. Google has its own algorithm for searching content. So, we can see a lot of mixed results and form our own opinion. IMO, getting a fixed answer from an AI might lead to some form of bias or frustration if it falls into the wrong hands.</p><p>In conclusion, ChatGPT is a powerful and versatile language model that can be used for a variety of tasks, from generating text to answering questions. It is trained on a large amount of text data and has the ability to understand and generate human-like responses. With its ability to learn and adapt to new information, ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with language and technology. Whether you’re a researcher, a developer, or just someone who is curious about the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, ChatGPT is definitely worth exploring.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/330/0*dYV9c6REiLMqTQFb.png\" /></figure><p>Tripti is a curious techie and a philomath, working at TribalScale as an Agile Software Engineer.

It is based on OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model and trained on an Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*FJdH5UEbmVfTHg7s\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\">ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Now you must be thinking how is it useful to us? Well, it provides very factual detailed responses to every question asked. Their website claims the following:</p><blockquote>While we have safeguards in place, the system may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information and produce offensive or biased content. It is not intended to give advice.</blockquote><blockquote>Conversations may be reviewed by our AI trainers to improve our systems.</blockquote><p>This leads us to the conclusion that we cannot solely rely on the accuracy as it’s in a childhood phase. The best part is that ChatGPT is a stateful bot, unlike other chatbots. This gives us hope that given the right information, it’ll remember the right kind of data.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xUaNPnt8q0AgOmUTmcKj9g.png\" /><figcaption>It’s setting right examples, even if a kid tries it 😋</figcaption></figure><p>It also filters data through its own moderation API, ensuring no illegal, hateful or offensive prompts. Here’s an example of the moderation upon asking for a sample of a ‘Phishing email’ :</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/843/1*H2UHb1pzxV1ZKjv1vQdqBw.png\" /></figure><p>For developers who are looking for some error finding in their code, they can rely on ChatGPT. We are still not claiming complete accuracy and efficiency here. But it’s still something.</p><p>But hold your horses…</p><p>One of the biggest cons of ChatGPT is that it may learn vague information from users and present prompts like a CEO is a white male.</p><p>Also, it might not have complete knowledge of current events or some celebrities. Of course, we can’t expect it to be as knowledgeable as Google, as it was released recently. But it’s evolving fast.</p><p>So far it has had positive reviews from people around the globe. Alas, I can’t find the answer to one of life’s <strong>biggest</strong> mysteries (Notice I changed the first word of the question, leading to a completely opposite reply. No judgement on my grammatical skills 😂🤫):</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oOla2iC9fQVbUgF70cL1WQ.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*T8A7Jf43ULDH1D4-b052ow.png\" /></figure><p>Overall, I would say it would be a great tool to get personalized and human- like replies quite quickly. Google has its own algorithm for searching content. So, we can see a lot of mixed results and form our own opinion. IMO, getting a fixed answer from an AI might lead to some form of bias or frustration if it falls into the wrong hands.</p><p>In conclusion, ChatGPT is a powerful and versatile language model that can be used for a variety of tasks, from generating text to answering questions. It is trained on a large amount of text data and has the ability to understand and generate human-like responses. With its ability to learn and adapt to new information, ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with language and technology. Whether you’re a researcher, a developer, or just someone who is curious about the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, ChatGPT is definitely worth exploring.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/330/0*dYV9c6REiLMqTQFb.png\" /></figure><p>Tripti is a curious techie and a philomath, working at TribalScale as an Agile Software Engineer.

These technologies are already being used in a variety of industries, from healthcare and finance to retail and transportation, and their adoption is only expected to increase in the coming year. AI and ML will be used to automate tasks, improve customer experiences, and provide organizations with valuable insights and data-driven decision making. Just this past month we have seen the explosive growth for ChatGPT by OpenAI.</p><h4><strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong></h4><p>The growing importance of data privacy and security. As more and more organizations collect and store sensitive customer data, the need for effective data privacy and security measures will become increasingly crucial. This will involve not only implementing the appropriate technical measures, but also ensuring that organizations have the necessary policies and procedures in place to protect customer data. We will also see a push for transparency so users actually know how their data is being used. I for one have not have AI turn me into art because of privacy concerns.</p><h4><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></h4><p>This has been on my list every year — The increasing adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing has already become an essential part of many organizations’ IT infrastructure, and this trend is only expected to continue in 2023. The cloud offers organizations a number of benefits, including increased flexibility, scalability, and cost savings.</p><p>As a result, more and more organizations are expected to move their operations to the cloud in the coming year. We will see more and more organizations require a scalable platform to build applications on top of based on their business needs. Watch out for more platforms and new cloud native applications being built rather than the lift and shift we have been experiencing.</p><h4><strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong></h4><p>The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT refers to the growing network of connected devices that are able to communicate with each other and exchange data. This trend is expected to continue to grow in 2023, with more and more devices becoming connected and more organizations using IoT technology to improve their operations and enhance the customer experience. I’ve even started to see connected toothbrushes so what won’t be connected? Everything will be connected but this does bring up bandwidth concerns for our current infrastructure.</p><h4><strong>Digital Customer Experiences</strong></h4><p>The growing importance of digital customer experiences. As more and more organizations compete for customers in the digital marketplace, the quality of the customer experience will become increasingly important. This will involve not only providing customers with a seamless and convenient online experience, but also personalizing the customer experience based on their individual preferences and needs. The pandemic made organizations start to think more digital but now consumers demand more and better experiences. Also as employees work remotely look for better enterprise solutions for the workforce. UI/UX and best practices will be a major emphasis in 2023.</p><p>Overall, these trends point to a future in which technology plays an increasingly important role in every aspect of our lives. As organizations continue to embrace digital transformation, they will need to stay on top of these trends in order to remain competitive and provide their customers with the best possible experiences.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ndfTQA-lrx34Ac7fdn5Kxw.png\" /></figure><p>Sheetal is a passionate advocate for Digital Transformation and Global Innovation.

While the COVID-19 pandemic stunted the attendance numbers of the past couple years, we’re likely to see a bounce-back at CES 2023 with <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/ces-2023-could-attract-100000-in-person-attendees/\">100,000 in-person attendees expected</a>.</p><p>The team at TribalScale is super excited to be attending this coming January, myself included. While there are currently <a href=\"https://www.ces.tech/topics/tech-topics.aspx\">24 topics</a> listed on the CES official site, there are a few tech trends that we’ll be specifically looking out for at the show.</p><h3>Trends we’re keeping an eye on</h3><h4>The metaverse and Web3</h4><p>This past year, we’ve been helping more and more clients in various industries to develop a Web3 strategy. NFTs and metaverse platforms are becoming a growing channel to engage customers through unique virtual communities and experiences, so our team was especially excited to hear Web3 announced as a new product category this year.</p><p>Kinsey Fabrizio, SVP of Membership & Sales at CTA said in a <a href=\"https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/cta-expects-to-double-ces-attendance-from-2022\">virtual press conference</a> that the Web3 category “will encompass technologies from the metaverse digital assets and blockchain” and that we’ll “see it show up with shared immersive and virtual experiences as well as the hardware associated with these categories.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ces-2023-on-track-for-record-post-pandemic-growth-301690814.html\">CoinDesk will also be hosting a Web3 studio</a> featuring interviews with leaders in Web3 and covering innovations in cryptocurrency and blockchain—definitely an event our team will want to attend.</p><p>Alongside companies like <a href=\"https://ovrtechnology.com/\">OVR</a> that creates immersive tech allowing users to smell in virtual reality, metaverse will be a trend we see across multiple industries. <a href=\"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/ces-2023-tech-world-gather-170428522.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM0Frd85wFpxupk8mPDP9qTpjrRqNuXyEIuLG6a1MxvPHJKf4kXWIa9wIYBtoLrJdN-W1l2QXY4JwMPv7E5ZZp-_EvQ59MH8aLgbrHMkvF_wrbUSLruQyYMCRyujIUlR6oC27MgUU3nExfe7UXykAdLmH-ha-1t33rLUpKZstPdc\">Auto company Stellantis is partnering with Microsoft to create a metaverse showroom</a>. As Fabrizio mentions, it will be eye-opening to hear brands talk “about unique ways to reach their customers, and different experiences people can have there.”</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about Web3, check out our recent webinar where our team shared expertise on a variety of Web3 topics including how smart contracts work, on vs off-chain transaction, Web3 market trends and more.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FtEVBfe3gxrs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtEVBfe3gxrs&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FtEVBfe3gxrs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/6b717c033f97933487e724f1d271fdef/href\">https://medium.com/media/6b717c033f97933487e724f1d271fdef/href</a></iframe><h4>Vehicle tech</h4><p>In the process of establishing ourselves as experts in Android Automotive OS (AAOS), we’ve been highly interested in the future of connected vehicles and tech surrounding in-vehicle experiences.</p><p>Fabrizio mentions that “CES is going to be the largest auto tech show in North America,” and that doesn’t just include major carmakers, we’ll also be seeing various automotive suppliers suppliers. With both <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stellantis-to-keynote-at-ces-2023-301691883.html\">Stellantis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bmw-to-keynote-at-ces-2023-301647924.html\">BMW AG</a> set to deliver keynote addresses, as well as the near 300 automotive exhibitors covering around 25% of the show’s floor space, the industry is solidified as a focus area.</p><p>The future of in-vehicle user experience points towards immersive driving experiences that are both safe and intuitive. Here are two showcases on our team’s radar:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://financialpost.com/pmn/press-releases-pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/continental-brings-the-future-of-mobility-to-ces-2023\">Continental’s</a> Curved Ultrawide Display that spans the entire cockpit of a vehicle with a width of nearly 4ft, arching from one A-pillar to the other, and featuring an invisible control panel.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/co-create-whats-next-at-ces-2023-marelli-to-showcase-cutting-edge-technologies-that-drive-vehicle-personality-and-performance-301695722.html\">Automotive supplier Marelli’s</a> invite-only, interactive experience on vehicle personality and performance. Attendees will define their brand’s DNA by personalizing their own vehicle, including lighting, sensing, electronics, and interior options.</li></ul><p>Check out our past blogs where we explore designing for emerging vehicle tech:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/tribalscale/designing-for-android-automotive-os-35d6e989ee6f\">Designing the AccuWeather App for Android Automotive OS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/tribalscale/designing-the-driving-experience-of-tomorrow-6a7e0a532004\">Designing the Driving Experience of Tomorrow</a></li></ul><h4>Health & wellness tech</h4><p>Health care has been noted as a major theme this year with VP of CES, John Kelley, confirming in a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/features/ces-2023-the-biggest-trends-to-watch\">virtual press conference</a> that we’ll see “two days of conference programming centered around digital health”. Both women-focused and elderly-focused health technology will be two areas to look out for.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.emergencyphysicians.org/press-releases/2022/12-5-22-acep-presents-the-digital-health-studio-at-ces-2023\">The Digital Health Studio hosted by ACEP</a> will include conversations will innovators in health care tech to discuss “discuss trends shaping the future of care delivery and innovations in treatment.”</p><p>Our team’s work with clients like <a href=\"https://nurosene.com/\">Nurosene</a> has allowed us to grow our expertise with science-backed wellness solutions. Wellness tech specifically has been a growing theme over the past few years at CES—we’re especially interested in this area. Here are two areas to watch this year:</p><ul><li><strong>Wearables</strong>—tech worn by the user that is used to track metrics and collect wellness insights. An example we’ll see showcased is the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ces-2023-somalytics-revolutionizes-home-140700892.html\">SomaSleep mask by Somalytics</a> that tracks the user’s eye movements “to help consumers better understand sleep stages, quality and disruptions”.</li><li><strong>Smart home</strong>—tech that is embedded within the home giving users a whole new level of control over their environment. <a href=\"https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/about-us/events/ces-1.html\">Bosch will be showcasing their new solution for air quality measurement</a>, mitigating the effects of fine dust and indoor air pollution.</li></ul><h3>Meet our team</h3><p>We’ll be at the conference exploring the exhibitors on the show floor and even hosting our own Innovators Happy Hour.

While there are currently <a href=\"https://www.ces.tech/topics/tech-topics.aspx\">24 topics</a> listed on the CES official site, there are a few tech trends that we’ll be specifically looking out for at the show.</p><h3>Trends we’re keeping an eye on</h3><h4>The metaverse and Web3</h4><p>This past year, we’ve been helping more and more clients in various industries to develop a Web3 strategy. NFTs and metaverse platforms are becoming a growing channel to engage customers through unique virtual communities and experiences, so our team was especially excited to hear Web3 announced as a new product category this year.</p><p>Kinsey Fabrizio, SVP of Membership & Sales at CTA said in a <a href=\"https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/cta-expects-to-double-ces-attendance-from-2022\">virtual press conference</a> that the Web3 category “will encompass technologies from the metaverse digital assets and blockchain” and that we’ll “see it show up with shared immersive and virtual experiences as well as the hardware associated with these categories.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ces-2023-on-track-for-record-post-pandemic-growth-301690814.html\">CoinDesk will also be hosting a Web3 studio</a> featuring interviews with leaders in Web3 and covering innovations in cryptocurrency and blockchain—definitely an event our team will want to attend.</p><p>Alongside companies like <a href=\"https://ovrtechnology.com/\">OVR</a> that creates immersive tech allowing users to smell in virtual reality, metaverse will be a trend we see across multiple industries. <a href=\"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/ces-2023-tech-world-gather-170428522.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM0Frd85wFpxupk8mPDP9qTpjrRqNuXyEIuLG6a1MxvPHJKf4kXWIa9wIYBtoLrJdN-W1l2QXY4JwMPv7E5ZZp-_EvQ59MH8aLgbrHMkvF_wrbUSLruQyYMCRyujIUlR6oC27MgUU3nExfe7UXykAdLmH-ha-1t33rLUpKZstPdc\">Auto company Stellantis is partnering with Microsoft to create a metaverse showroom</a>. As Fabrizio mentions, it will be eye-opening to hear brands talk “about unique ways to reach their customers, and different experiences people can have there.”</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about Web3, check out our recent webinar where our team shared expertise on a variety of Web3 topics including how smart contracts work, on vs off-chain transaction, Web3 market trends and more.</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FtEVBfe3gxrs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtEVBfe3gxrs&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FtEVBfe3gxrs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/6b717c033f97933487e724f1d271fdef/href\">https://medium.com/media/6b717c033f97933487e724f1d271fdef/href</a></iframe><h4>Vehicle tech</h4><p>In the process of establishing ourselves as experts in Android Automotive OS (AAOS), we’ve been highly interested in the future of connected vehicles and tech surrounding in-vehicle experiences.</p><p>Fabrizio mentions that “CES is going to be the largest auto tech show in North America,” and that doesn’t just include major carmakers, we’ll also be seeing various automotive suppliers suppliers. With both <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stellantis-to-keynote-at-ces-2023-301691883.html\">Stellantis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bmw-to-keynote-at-ces-2023-301647924.html\">BMW AG</a> set to deliver keynote addresses, as well as the near 300 automotive exhibitors covering around 25% of the show’s floor space, the industry is solidified as a focus area.</p><p>The future of in-vehicle user experience points towards immersive driving experiences that are both safe and intuitive. Here are two showcases on our team’s radar:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://financialpost.com/pmn/press-releases-pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/continental-brings-the-future-of-mobility-to-ces-2023\">Continental’s</a> Curved Ultrawide Display that spans the entire cockpit of a vehicle with a width of nearly 4ft, arching from one A-pillar to the other, and featuring an invisible control panel.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/co-create-whats-next-at-ces-2023-marelli-to-showcase-cutting-edge-technologies-that-drive-vehicle-personality-and-performance-301695722.html\">Automotive supplier Marelli’s</a> invite-only, interactive experience on vehicle personality and performance. Attendees will define their brand’s DNA by personalizing their own vehicle, including lighting, sensing, electronics, and interior options.</li></ul><p>Check out our past blogs where we explore designing for emerging vehicle tech:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/tribalscale/designing-for-android-automotive-os-35d6e989ee6f\">Designing the AccuWeather App for Android Automotive OS</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/tribalscale/designing-the-driving-experience-of-tomorrow-6a7e0a532004\">Designing the Driving Experience of Tomorrow</a></li></ul><h4>Health & wellness tech</h4><p>Health care has been noted as a major theme this year with VP of CES, John Kelley, confirming in a <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/features/ces-2023-the-biggest-trends-to-watch\">virtual press conference</a> that we’ll see “two days of conference programming centered around digital health”. Both women-focused and elderly-focused health technology will be two areas to look out for.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.emergencyphysicians.org/press-releases/2022/12-5-22-acep-presents-the-digital-health-studio-at-ces-2023\">The Digital Health Studio hosted by ACEP</a> will include conversations will innovators in health care tech to discuss “discuss trends shaping the future of care delivery and innovations in treatment.”</p><p>Our team’s work with clients like <a href=\"https://nurosene.com/\">Nurosene</a> has allowed us to grow our expertise with science-backed wellness solutions. Wellness tech specifically has been a growing theme over the past few years at CES—we’re especially interested in this area. Here are two areas to watch this year:</p><ul><li><strong>Wearables</strong>—tech worn by the user that is used to track metrics and collect wellness insights. An example we’ll see showcased is the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ces-2023-somalytics-revolutionizes-home-140700892.html\">SomaSleep mask by Somalytics</a> that tracks the user’s eye movements “to help consumers better understand sleep stages, quality and disruptions”.</li><li><strong>Smart home</strong>—tech that is embedded within the home giving users a whole new level of control over their environment. <a href=\"https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/about-us/events/ces-1.html\">Bosch will be showcasing their new solution for air quality measurement</a>, mitigating the effects of fine dust and indoor air pollution.</li></ul><h3>Meet our team</h3><p>We’ll be at the conference exploring the exhibitors on the show floor and even hosting our own Innovators Happy Hour.

Tangible outcomes are defined at the outset, and TribalScale’s experts guide the team in making changes to their workflows. The transformation leads to both an improvement in the development process, while delivering a product of tangible business value.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iDTgplZ679ME079s\" /></figure><p>As your organization begins its digital transformation journey, we should be cognizant of the impact leadership has on the team’s effort. Great leadership facilitates the team’s work, and focuses efforts towards desirable outcomes. Being a great leader for your team is not only having a certain set of managerial skills, but also about consistently demonstrating support for the team. Here are some tips on how to be the best leader for your team during this period of change and uncertainty.</p><h4><strong>1. Achieve buy-in from top leadership</strong></h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/870/0*Sc-75GDEIn_R6SK1\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@krakenimages?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">krakenimages</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Buy-in and motivation needs to exist from all levels of the organization, in order for digital transformation to succeed. In particular, it would be very difficult for team members to recognize the benefits of transformation without senior leadership being on board. Promote why the initiative is important and what value it brings to the business. Examine similar companies with similar issues that have undergone transformation journeys.</p><p>Digital transformation can be thought of as balancing business continuity with process innovation. As a business, your organization is likely doing many things right — ensure that those positive aspects are not lost. Showcase the shortcomings in your processes, and demonstrate to your peers in leadership the strong ROI that digital transformation can bring. Acknowledge and mitigate any risks associated with the effort.</p><h4><strong>2. Communicate effectively with the team</strong></h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*IfWRANKENMaNC3sR\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/diverse-workplace-KYKS8UATHF\">StockSnap</a></figcaption></figure><p>Clear and effective communication is essential for any leader. During digital transformation efforts, an organization should anticipate many changes to processes and workflows. Some of them could be radical to team members who have settled into one way of doing things. Support your team by providing transparency — share your view of the organization’s pain points, and provide contrast against your vision of how things <em>should</em> be. Emphasize the reasons <em>why </em>these transformation efforts are happening, and encourage the team to have an open mind regarding necessary changes.</p><p>Provide channels for safe, honest, and anonymized feedback.<strong> </strong>Share important information with your team, while actively listening and responding to their feedback and concerns. Such impactful communication can help with several critical factors:</p><ul><li>Build trust and foster a positive team environment.</li><li>Validate suspected pain points that the organization had set out to mitigate.</li><li>Refine and iterate new processes that solve said pain points, and improve efficiency.</li></ul><h4><strong>3. Set clear goals and expectations</strong></h4><p>Your organization’s digital transformation would have tangible goals in mind, focusing your team’s efforts on doing the right tasks to create positive impact, while improving the development process. The transformation journey requires a clear vision for your team, and the leaders to effectively communicate that vision.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YpAn_fFXkJQciGyM\" /></figure><p>Your vision should be summarized as a set of goals for the team. A popular framework calls for setting <strong>s</strong>pecific, <strong>m</strong>easurable, <strong>a</strong>chievable, <strong>r</strong>elevant, and <strong>t</strong>ime-bound (SMART) goals. SMART goals can help ensure that your transformation efforts bring maximum return with less wasted resources. Ensure clear communication of these team goals — your team members will be in a better position to judge what tasks will positively support the defined goals.</p><p>Similarly, have your supervisors work with your employees to set up SMART personal goals. As a great manager, you should have a clear idea of where your reports want to take their career. Aim for synergy between your team members’ personal growth and the digital transformation goals. As the employee performs their tasks in support of the transformation effort, they can contribute achievements towards their personal goals- filling two needs with one deed.</p><h4><strong>4. Provide training and resources</strong></h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bH6V5oSPknsJhR_M\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mimithian?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Mimi Thian</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Any leader worth their salt will have a solid understanding of their team’s capabilities and strengths, and recognize that their team members need proper support and resources in order to be successful. Three important support factors are <em>skills, will, </em>and<em> tools.</em></p><p><strong>Skills</strong> are your organization’s technical competencies, both in terms of the team’s capabilities and individual members’ abilities. As a manager, you will have an understanding of your team’s abilities and strengths — compare those against the skills required by the transformation effort. <strong><br></strong>Allow a safe space for your team to self-assess their familiarity with the needed skills. Set up a plan to upskill contributors in whatever area is needed. Identify and encourage team members that can share expertise and mentor others. If needed, provide external mentors that can support the team from technical or process perspectives.</p><h4><strong>5.

As we explored in section 1, one critical step is to provide clarity on why the transformation is happening. Be on the same page with your team regarding why the effort is necessary. Acknowledge their concerns and feedback, and adjust the transformation process as required. When you are confident your team is onboard with the transformation goals, be supportive of their efforts and provide frequent feedback on their progress.</p><p>Great leaders understand that their team members are their most valuable asset. It is critical to empower them by giving the autonomy and support that they need. This can include providing regular feedback and recognition. Are your organization’s incentive structures set up correctly? Success towards the transformation effort should translate into commensurate rewards, whether in terms career growth or compensation growth.</p><h4><strong>6. Foster collaboration and teamwork</strong></h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*BW7e4XBK2dxsEqR-\" /></figure><p>Finally, provide the right <strong>tools</strong> for your team during the transformation journey. Does your team have the right tools to finish their mission? Listen to your team’s feedback on what tools they would like to harness, and provide these tools. Each organization will have different needs, but here is a short list of possibilities:</p><ul><li>Collaboration spaces, whether in-person, hybrid, virtual, or even in the metaverse</li><li>The right amount of meetings, involving the right people, contributing the right insights.</li><li>Software tools including instant messaging, whiteboarding apps for video sharing, etc.</li><li>Opportunities for team building</li></ul><p>Encourage your team members to work together, and provide them with the time, support, and resources they need to succeed.</p><h4><strong>In conclusion</strong></h4><p>Digital Transformation isn’t just a change in protocol, or changing up processes. It is also a transformation in you and your team’s mindset — and thinking about what can be improved in your work cycle. Team success requires leadership to provide a clear vision and logical expectations of the desired outcomes, plus the skills, will, and tools to achieve those goals.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SDTiy1b4y4BIelE2ivZxjw.png\" /></figure><p>Sheetal Jaitly, CEO & Founder of TribalScale and Alvin Fong, Senior Engineer Manager at TribalScale, have both been involved in building out our digital transformation services.

Team success requires leadership to provide a clear vision and logical expectations of the desired outcomes, plus the skills, will, and tools to achieve those goals.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SDTiy1b4y4BIelE2ivZxjw.png\" /></figure><p>Sheetal Jaitly, CEO & Founder of TribalScale and Alvin Fong, Senior Engineer Manager at TribalScale, have both been involved in building out our digital transformation services.

Preparing the base layout of Storyboard</h4><p>Here’s the complete storyboard layout:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/795/1*4srLvJGxWIdKk2ifdtxNMA.png\" /><figcaption>Storyboard Layout</figcaption></figure><p>The first and foremost step is to define an Initial View Controller. This would be the entry point of the application at run time. In this tutorial, it would be a Tab Bar Controller. Select the option on left hand: is Initial View Controller. There’ll be an arrow pointing to the Tab Bar Controller as you can see below:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/1*WLwPDGo0tKGVrzKEFdwj2g.png\" /><figcaption>Defining Initial View Controller</figcaption></figure><p>Next step would be to add 3 Navigation View Controllers as child view controllers. The Navigation View Controllers will each have a View Controller as their child view controller. We’ll name the child view controller as ‘Feed’ , ‘Profile’ and ‘Albums’.</p><h4><strong>2. </strong>Designing the child views</h4><p>Let’s start with designing our first view which is the Feed view (UIViewController). Furthermore, we’ll add an UIImageView at the top and add a container view at the bottom. You’ll shortly see why. I have set a specific Height, Width, Top and Aligned Center X to Superview. You can set it to whatever you like. I have also added a pretty anime image to the UIImageView.</p><p>Now adding a container view will automatically add a new view controller and a segue pointing towards it. Set the underlying class of this new VC to TableViewController. For the purpose of this tutorial, I have set the Content to Static Cells with 1 Section. Also I have added 3 rows with few lovely comments. Feel free to experiment with a dynamic table or with some other types of views.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dS6Z4cLZE8RP6iFIiYV9MQ.png\" /><figcaption>Set TableViewController properties</figcaption></figure><p>When running the app, now you’ll see following output:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/324/1*uvpMHK4TbNG7UpaT0KbITw.gif\" /><figcaption>Feed View Controller</figcaption></figure><p>Congratulations on designing your first purely UI based screen with relevant data.
